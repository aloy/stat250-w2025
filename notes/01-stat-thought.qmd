## Three prongs of statistics

1. **Design** <br>
The design of surveys/experiments and collection of data to more efficiently/correctly address scientific questions <br/> <br/>

:::{.fragment}

2. **Exploration** <br>
Understand the major features of and detect patterns in data <br/> <br/>

3. **Inference** <br>
Account for randomness, variability, and bias in a sample in order to draw reasonable and correct conclusions about a population

## Statistics vs. probability


#### Probability (Math 240)

We learned how to calculate the probability of seeing a result (data) given a specific probability model (e.g., a specific distribution)

#### Statistics (Stat 250)

We will learn how to make statements about the underlying probability models given the data we see

## Example: Spies vs. Statisticians

During WWII, the Allies wanted to determine production rates of tanks (and airplanes, missiles, etc.)


#### Spies
Gathered intelligence (intercepted messages, interrogated of prisoners, etc.) and made the following estimates:

* June 1940: 1000
* June 1941: 1550
* August 1942: 1550



## Example: Spies vs. Statisticians

#### Statisticians

* The Allies had a sample of serial numbers (via capture, photography, etc.), $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$, and there were $N$ produced.

* Allied statisticians needed to devise an **estimator** to obtain $N$

* Ultimately, they used $\widehat{N} = X_{\text{max}} + \dfrac{X_{\text{max}}}{n} - 1$

    + June 1940: 169
    + June 1941: 244
    + August 1942: 327




## Example: Spies vs. Statisticians


After the war, the Allies discovered documents revealing the true number of tanks produced:

Month | Truth | Statisticians | Spies
----- | :----: | :----: | :----:
June 1940    | 122 | 169 | 1000
June 1941    | 271 | 244 | 1550
August 1942 | 342 | 327 | 1550

## Statistical models

A statistical model consists of

* a collection of random variables to describe observable data,

* the possible joint distribution(s) of the random variables,

* and the parameters, $\boldsymbol \theta$, that define those distributions

(Morris and DeGroot, 377)



## Types of Inference in Stat 250


#### Nonparametric

> The basic idea of nonparametric inference is to use data to infer an unknown quantity while making as few assumptions as possible. Usually, this means using statistical models that are infinite-dimensional.  (Wasserman, 2006)

:::{.fragment}
#### Parametric

> A parametric inference uses models that consist of a set of distributions/densities that can be parameterized by a finite number of parameters.

Topic | Chapters | Approx. Duration

Exploratory Data Analysis | 1-2 | 1 week 
Nonparametric inference | 3-5 | 3 weeks 
Parametric inference | 6-10 | 6 weeks 




# Types of Studies




## Experimental

Investigators apply treatments to experimental units (people,
animals, plots of land, etc.) and then proceed to observe the effect of the 
treatments on the experimental units



## Observational 

Investigators
observe subjects and measure variables
of interest without assigning treatments to
the subjects. The "treatment" that each
subject receives is determined beyond the
control of the investigator.
