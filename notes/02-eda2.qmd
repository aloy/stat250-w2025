## Recommended workflow

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
1. Create an R project to keep your files organized (this creates a new folder)
 
1. Keep all of your data (inputs) in a `data/` folder (for now we'll read from URLs)

1. Download/create an RMarkdown (.Rmd) file to house both your thoughts and your R code; this will keep both your work and your final products in one place

1. While you're writing your code (i.e., drafting your analysis) run the chunks in the console; when you are finished, knit to PDF (or Word)

## Why RMarkdown?

* The analysis is self-documenting

* It's easy to extend or refine analyses by copying and modifying code blocks

* The analysis can be disseminated by providing the RMarkdown file and data sources

* The results can also be shared as HTML (fully self contained), PDF, or Word if just a summary of the analysis is needed

## Metadata

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
The header stores the necessary metadata for your document

* Always start and end with three hyphens `---`

* Put the text for the title, author, and date in quotes

* Let RStudio take care of the indentation for you

title: "My First RMarkdown Document"
author: "Adam Loy"
date: "01/10/2025"
output: pdf_document

```

## Code chunks

    `r ''````{r}
    1 + 2 * 3
    20:30
    mean(rnorm(20))
    ```

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* Always begin and end with three backticks

* Additional options can be placed inside of the brackets

* The lines wrapped inside the beginning and closing three backticks must be R code that you could run in the R Console.

## Headers (titles)

Headers start with hashtags

```md
# Top-level header 

## A second-level header

### A third-level header
```

<br>

:::{.fragment}

### Text

Write your thoughts in plain text

:::

## Mathematical expressions

You can write mathematical expressions using [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) code

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
`$\alpha + \beta$`

$\alpha + \beta$

`$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$`

$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$

`$S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2$`

$S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2$
