# Statistical significance <br> â‰  <br> Practical importance


# If you run multiple tests, make adjustments


## Example

Suppose you want to run $k$ hypothesis tests, each at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level. 

Assume that the tests are independent.

What is the overall probability of making a type I error?


## Sidak correction for $\alpha$

Let $\alpha$ be the desired type I error rate for $k$ tests.

Use $\alpha^* = 1 - (1-\alpha)^{1/k}$ as the significance level for each test.

# Don't p-hack
